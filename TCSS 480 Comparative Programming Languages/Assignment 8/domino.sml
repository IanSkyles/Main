Problems: Eulers function not implemented. I couldn't figure out how to do it.
I did resarch and try to find out about the algorithms you mentioned but,
I couldn't figure it out.

(*
dominoes(N : int) – given an integer, returns a list of tuples containing all the tiles in the set of double-N, e.g. dominoes(2) returns some variation of [(2 , 2), (2 , 1), (2 , 0), (1 , 1), (1 , 0), (0 , 0)] – order does not matter; any helper function that you use should be an inner function
*)
(*In short, this generates all possible tiles under (N,N). *)
(*
So, im thinking i will need to subtract from each side recursively.
For example: (n,n) then (n,n-1) then (n,n-2) (until right side is zero)
Then we must subtract 1 from left and right starting point and repeat. 
So, (n-1,n-1) then (n-1, n-2) (until right side is zero).
We must continue this until we get (0,0). 
It should return a list of tuples!
*)

(*Short: takes a number and 
	generates (recurisvely all possible dominos for (N,N) or less)*)
fun dominoes(N : int) =
	let
		fun createDominoes(left : int, right : int) =
			case right of 
			0 => 
				(case left of
				0 => 
					[(0,0)]
				| _ => 
					(*
					We need to decrease right side (and set left side to the
					same number) on next call. So, (n-1,n-1).
					*)
					(left,right)::createDominoes(left-1, left-1))
			| _ =>
				(*
				We must decrease only the left side. 
				The call should be (n, n-1)
				*)
				((left,right)::createDominoes(left, right-1))
	in
		if (N > ~1) (*we do not have dominoes less than 0*)
			then
				createDominoes(N,N)
		else
			[]
	end


(*Eulers(L : (int * int) list) – given a list of tuples, returns a reordered
list of tuples that forms one of possible circular trains, e.g. given a list
 from the bullet above, the function may return 
 [(2 , 1), (1 , 1), (1 , 0), (0 , 0), (2 , 0), (2 , 2)] (this is the function 
 in which you will use Fleury's or Hierholzer's algorithm).*)


(*I couldn't figure out how to recurisvely make a graph and then solve it.
So, this just returns the answer for 2 at the moment so that I could test.*)
fun Eulers(L : (int * int) list) =
	[(2 , 1), (1 , 1), (1 , 0), (0 , 0), (2 , 0), (2 , 2)]



(*flip(L: (int * int) list) – given a list of tuples that form a circular 
train, returns a list with tiles that are flipped where appropriate to 
make the loop self-evident, e.g. if flip is applied to 
[(2 , 1), (1 , 1), (1 , 0), (0 , 0), (2 , 0), (2 , 2)], 
it results in [(2 , 1), (1 , 1), (1 , 0), (0 , 0), (0 , 2), (2 , 2)]*)

(*Flips any dominos that need flipping so that they are in order to
 make a circle. It doesn't rearrange (drag) dominos!
 Passes all test cases given. *)
fun flip(L: (int * int) list) =
	let

					if ((#2 one) <> (#1 two))
				then
					((#2 one, #1 one),two)
				else
					(one,two)
			in
				let 
					val swapped = swap(List.nth (oldList, cOne), List.nth (oldList, cTwo))
					val first = (#1 (swap(List.nth (oldList, cOne), List.nth (oldList, cTwo))))
					val second = (#2 (swap(List.nth (oldList, cOne), List.nth (oldList, cTwo))))
				in
					if(numLeft = 2)
						(*Val swapped is equal to the swapepd pair*)
					then
						first::second::[]						
					else
						first::second::flipper(oldList, newList, cOne + 2, cTwo + 2, numLeft - 2)
					end

(*given an integer, generates a solution – ties all the functions given above 
in a functional manner; note that there are no domino rings when N is odd 
and you should return an empty list in such a case*)

Creates all dominos, finds a eulers circuit for them, then flips what needs to
be flipped so that the dominos connect.*)

(*given listAsString and solution functions, as well as N
 - the initial highest number of dots for the set, returns a
  string representing a solution to the program, i.e. it should
   be enough to call this function to get the answer to the circular
   train question.*)

(*After setting it up with f2 as solution function and f1 as string function,
we can give it an N and instantly get solutions in string format for N dominos.*)
