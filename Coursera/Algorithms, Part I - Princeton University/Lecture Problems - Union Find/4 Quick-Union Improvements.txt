Question:

Suppose that the id[] array during the weighted quick union algorithm is
0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 8
Which id[] entry changes when we apply the union operation to 3 and 6?

Answer:

How to think about this? We can see that element 3 shares 0 with 6 total nodes (including itself).
Element 6 shares 8 with 3 total nodes. Therefore, we must point 8's id so that it is zero. Thus, 8's root (and id) is 0.

"In weighted quick union, we make the root of the smaller tree points to the root of the larger tree. In this example, the algorithm sets id[8] = 0.

Be careful not to confuse union-by-size with union-by-height—the former uses the size of the tree (number of nodes) while the latter uses the height of the tree (number of links on longest path from the root of the tree to a leaf node). Both variants guarantee logarithmic height. There is a third variant known as union-by-rank that is also widely used."
