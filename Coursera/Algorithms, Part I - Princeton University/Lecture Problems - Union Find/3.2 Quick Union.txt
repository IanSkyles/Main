Question:

What is the maximum number of array accesses during a find operation when using the quick-union data structure on N elements?

Answer:

How to think about this? We could have only one tree which is very long. It would take us N - 1 elements to start from the leaf node and get to the root. Therefore, it would take linear (N) time.
