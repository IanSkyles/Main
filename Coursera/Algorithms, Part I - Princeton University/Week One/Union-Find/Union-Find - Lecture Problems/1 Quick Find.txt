Question:

How many connected components result after performing the following sequence of union operations on a set of 10 items?
   1-2  3-4  5-6  7-8  7-9  2-8  0-5  1-9

Answer:

How to solve? Draw 10 numbered nodes and connect them with lines until you have done all of the union operations. count the number of groups (components)

"The three connected components are { 1 2 7 8 9 }, { 3 4 }, and { 0 5 6 }."
