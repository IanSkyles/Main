Consider an object of type GenericMysteryBox<Long> that stores N items of type Long
in a generic array items[] of length N.

    public class GenericMysteryBox<Item> {
        private int N;
        private Item[] items;

        ...
    }

Using the 64-bit memory cost model from the lecture, how many bytes does it use as a function of N?
Include all memory referenced by the object and use tilde notation to simplify your answer.
For example, enter ~ 4N if the number of bytes as a function of N is 4N + 32.

Hint: an object of the wrapper type Long uses 24 bytes.


Answer:

A correct answer matches the regular expression: \s*~?\s*32\s*N\s*
For example, the following is a correct answer: ~ 32N
Below is a detailed accounting:

public class GenericMysteryBox<Item> {        //       16 (object overhead)
    private int N;                            //        4 (int)
    private Item[] items;                     //        8 (reference to array)
                                              //  8N + 24 (array of Long references)
                                              //      24N (Long objects)
    ...                                                 4 (padding to round up to a multiple of 8)
}                                                 -------
                                                 32N + 56  ~ 32N

Final Answer: 
~32N
