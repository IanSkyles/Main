Question:

Which of the following statements is a type safe way to declare and initialize a Stack of integers?

Stack<int> stack = new Stack<int>();
Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack();
Stack stack = new Stack<Integer>();
Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<Integer>();

Answer:

linear time for enqueue and constant time for dequeue

How do we get this answer?

The first one doesn't use the generic type.
The second doesn't specify the type or use <> on the second part of the 
assignment.
The third doesn't use the <> one the first part. 
The fourth is the only choice left ;)

Instructor notes:

In Java 6, you must specify the concrete type both when you declare and when you construct the stack.
Starting in Java 7, you can use the diamond operator instead:

    Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
