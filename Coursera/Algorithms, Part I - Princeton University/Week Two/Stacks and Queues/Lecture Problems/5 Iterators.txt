Question:

Suppose that we copy the iterator code from our linked list and resizing array implementations of a stack to the corresponding implementations of a queue. 

Which queue iterator(s) will correctly return the items in FIFO order?

neither 
linked list iterator only 
array iterator only 
both

Answer:

linked list iterator only

How do we get this answer?


Our linked queue immplmentation dequed from the front. (FIFO)
Thus, it returns the order we would want.


Instructor notes:

The linked list iterator will work without modification because the items in the
linked list are ordered in FIFO order (which is the main reason we dequeue from
the front and enqueue to the back instead of vice versa). The array iterator
will fail for two reasons: (i) the items should be iterated over in the
opposite order and (ii) the items won't typically be stored in the array
as entries 0 to N-1.
