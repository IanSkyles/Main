Question:

Suppose that, starting from an empty data structure, we perform N push operations in our resizing array implementation of a stack. How many times is the resize() method called?

constant
logarithmic
linear
quadratic


Answer:

logarithmic

How do we get this answer?

The number of times we resize does depend on N so it isn't constant. 
The number of times we resize is under 1 time for each number in N so,
it isn't linear (or quadratic).
The number of times we resize is inbetween 0 and 1 times per number in N.
Therefore, it is logarithmic time.

Instructor notes:

Upon termination of the loop, x is a reference to the second to last node. The final statement deletes the last node from the list.
