Question:

How many compares does shellsort (using the 3x+1 increment sequence) 
make on an input array that is already sorted?

constant 
logarithmic
linear
linearithmic

Answer:

linearithmic (nlogn)

How do we get this answer?

Just run an example on a large size array.
(one where h will be 13 or higher.)


Instructor notes:

Since successive increment values of h differ by at least a factor of 3,
there are approximately log3N increment values. For each increment value h,
the array is already h-sorted so it will make approximately N compares.
