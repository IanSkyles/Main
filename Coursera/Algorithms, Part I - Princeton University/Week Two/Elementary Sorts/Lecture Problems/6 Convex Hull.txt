Question:

What is the maximum number of vertices that can be on the 
convex hull of a set of N points?

constant
logarithmic
linear
linearithmic

Answer:

linear

How do we get this answer?

imagine n = 3. A goes to B, B goes to C, and C goes A.


Instructor notes:

If the input points are points on the circumference of a circle (or a regular N-gon), then all N points will be on the convex hull.
