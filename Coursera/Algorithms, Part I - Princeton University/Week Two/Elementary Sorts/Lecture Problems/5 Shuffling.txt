Question:

How many possible permutations are there of a deck of 52 playing cards?
2^52 
52*52 
52! 
52^52


Answer:

52!

How do we get this answer?

Well after placing one card in it's slot, we can only place n-1 cards
in random spots. After that n-2. It continues all the way down until we
can only put the last card in one spot. 
Therefore, 52*51*50*49*...*1 = 52! 


Instructor notes:

Since successive increment values of h differ by at least a factor of 3,
there are approximately log3N increment values. For each increment value h,
the array is already h-sorted so it will make approximately N compares.
