Question:

Consider the data type Temp defined below. Which of the following required
properties of the Comparable interface does the compareTo() method violate?



public class Temp implements Comparable<Temp> {
    private final double deg;
	    public Temp(double deg) {
            this.deg = deg;
        }

        public int compareTo(Temp that) {       
            double EPS = 0.1;
            if (this.deg < that.deg - EPS)
                return -1;
            if (this.deg > that.deg + EPS)
                return +1;
            return  0;
        }

}

    Antisymmetry
    Transitivity
    Totality
    None of the above

Answer:

Transitivity

How do we get this answer?


See intstructors notes. 
We are introducing a margin of error by adding and subtracting EPS (.1).


Instructor notes:

Transitivity is violated. Suppose that a, b, and c refer to objects 
corresponding to temperatures of 10.16∘, 10.08∘, and 10.00∘, respectively.
Then, a.compareTo(b) ≤ 0 and b.compareTo(c) ≤ 0, but a.compareTo(c) > 0.
For this reason, you must not introduce a fudge factor when comparing two
floating-point numbers if you want to implement the Comparable interface.
