Question:

How many compares does mergesort—the pure version without any optimizations—make to sort an input array that is already sorted?

constant
logarithmic
linear
linearithmic

Answer:

linearithmic (NlogN)


Instructor notes:

It makes ~1/2 NlgN compares, which is the best case for mergesort. We note that the optimized version that checks whether a[mid]≤a[mid+1] only requires ~N compares.
